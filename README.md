# android-test

The test is quite simple and doesnt require specific libraries knowledge. It consist in two activities; 
* SplashActivity,
* MainActivity. 

The idea is you can implement the following tasks:

1. The application should start with the SplashActivity, show a progress bar in the middle of the screen and after 3 seconds launch the MainActivity, which from now on is the only available on the back stack. 
2. On the MainActivity, we are going to show a list of Images in a simple listview or recyclerview which you should load from the API rest defined in the DataController. 

No more than that.

Apply what ever knowledge and libraries you like, use orpeople are talking about. We already add some tips on the source code. The test should not take you more than 2 hours.

Cool beans!
